# cms-to-bib

This repository contains a bibliography (in Bibtex format) for all datasets provided by  the [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov)
to researchers in the [Federal Statitical Research Data Centers](https://www.census.gov/fsrdc), as of 2014.

This list does not claim to be exhaustive, nor is it being (actively) updated by the Census Bureau. It is provided as a utility to the community.

## Zotero

This list was mirrored on [Zotero](https://zotero.org) as a public group that anybody can use: https://www.zotero.org/groups/2245704/fsrdc

### Using Zotero groups
Through the Zotero website (join for free), search for "FSRDC" and add the group to your Zotero client. You can now cite the datasets!

## Sample web page
A sample bibliography can also be found at https://www.ncrn.cornell.edu/publications/cms-test/.

## Sample LaTeX document
Usage in a LaTeX document is demonstrated in [sample.tex](sample.tex) (see [sample.pdf](sample.pdf) for the rendered version).
